Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a game artist with experience in the game industry and multimedia. I've worked on AAA games like Dirt 5 in Codemasters, and now I spend most of my time working with Unity and C# to create engaging and immersive gaming experiences.

In addition to my work in the game industry, I'm passionate about learning and expanding my skill set. I have a strong interest in mathematics, coding, and AI, and have been dedicated to learning more about these areas. I'm also interested in exploring the world of virtual reality and creating experiences that truly immerse the user. Thank you for stopping by my page and feel free to explore my projects!
